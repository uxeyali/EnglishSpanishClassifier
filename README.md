# EnglishSpanishClassifier
We did this project as part of our final project for our Machine Learning class and we used Python to do it. 

It is a very basic language classifier, complete with its application that we created to sort Spanish and English documents into their appropriate folders.
We used data provided by another Git user https://github.com/FerreroJeremy/Cross-Language-Dataset to train our system to tell the difference between Spanish and English.

The algorithm we used has a two components that it needs to sort the documents:
1.	Feature Extraction
2.	Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes Classifier

We learnt what we needed by Zac Stewarts tutorial and used Python's scikit learn's Multinomial Naive Bayes package to create this application. 
We also created an application that can be run by anyone to sort the documents. We will continue our work on this application.
